# File I/O in Python
# Opening and Reading File
# f = open("file.txt", "r")
# data1 = f.readline()
# print(data1)

# data2 = f.readline()
# print(data2)
# f.close()


# Writing to a file
# f = open("file.txt", "w")

# f.write("This is new text")

# To Append New text

# f = open("file.txt", "a")

# f.write("\nThis text is appended")


# with Syntax 
# It automatically close file at the end
# with open("file.txt", "r") as  f:

#     data = f.read()
#     print(data)

# with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
#     f.write("This is new data with with Syntax")

# Deleting a file
